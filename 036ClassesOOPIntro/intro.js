// OOP
// One of several programming paradigms:
// 1. Functional
// 2. Logic
// 3. Event driven
// ....

//  A way to manage and thing about state
//  Models interactions within and between states
//  BASED ON THE concepts of "Object"
//  "Object" have data and code associated to them

// 4 main ideas of JS OOP
// 1. Inheritance
// 2. Encapsulation
// 3. Abstraction
// 4. Polymorphism

// JS is not a traditional "OOP language" (Prototypical language)
// "cLASSES " are built on top of prototypes
// We have an actual "Object" type in JS
//  We can "simulate" most/all of the core OOP concepts
